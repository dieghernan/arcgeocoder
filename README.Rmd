The goal of **arcgeocoder** is to provide a light interface for geocoding
addresses and reverse geocoding location trough the [ArcGIS REST API Geocoding
Service](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/overview-world-geocoding-service.htm).

Full site with examples and vignettes on
<https://dieghernan.github.io/arcgeocoder/>

## Why **arcgeocoder**?

**arcgeocoder** is a package that provides a lightweight interface for geocoding
and reverse geocoding with the ArcGIS REST API service. The goal of
**arcgeocoder** is to access the ArcGIS REST API with fewer dependencies, such
as **curl**. In some situations, **curl** may not be available or accessible, so
**arcgeocoder** uses base functions to overcome this limitation.

The interface of **apigeocoder** is built with the aim of easing the access to
all the features provided by the API. The API endpoints used by **arcgeocoder**
are `findAddressCandidates` and `reverseGeocode`, which can be accessed
[**without**]{.underline} the need for an [**API key**]{.underline}.

## Recommended packages

There are other packages much more complete and mature than **arcgeocoder**,
that presents similar features:

-   [**tidygeocoder**](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/)
    [@R-tidygeocoder]. Allows to interface with ArcGIS, Nominatim
    (OpenStreetMaps), Google, TomTom, Mapbox, etc. for geocoding and reverse
    geocoding.
-   [**nominatimlite**](https://dieghernan.github.io/nominatimlite/)
    [@R-nominatimlite]. Similar to **arcgeocoder** but using data from
    OpenStreetMaps trough the [Nominatim
    API](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/) service.

## Installation

Install **arcgeocoder** from
[**CRAN**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=arcgeocoder) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("arcgeocoder")
```

You can install the developing version of **arcgeocoder** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("dieghernan/arcgeocoder")
```

Alternatively, you can install **arcgeocoder** using the
[r-universe](https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev/arcgeocoder):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install arcgeocoder in R:
install.packages("arcgeocoder",
  repos = c(
    "https://dieghernan.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

## Usage

### Geocoding and reverse geocoding

*Note: examples adapted from **tidygeocoder** package*

In this first example we will geocode a few addresses using the `arc_geo()`
function. Note that **arcgeocoder** works straight away, and you don't need to
provide any API key to start geocoding!

```{r example}
library(arcgeocoder)
library(dplyr)

# create a dataframe with addresses
some_addresses <- tribble(
  ~name,                  ~addr,
  "White House",          "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC",
  "Transamerica Pyramid", "600 Montgomery St, San Francisco, CA 94111",
  "Willis Tower",         "233 S Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60606"
)

# geocode the addresses
lat_longs <- arc_geo(some_addresses$addr, lat = "latitude", long = "longitude")
```

Only a few fields are returned from the geocoder service in this example, but
`full_results = TRUE` can be used to return all of the data from the geocoder
service.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(lat_longs)
```

To perform reverse geocoding (obtaining addresses from geographic coordinates),
we can use the `arc_reverse_geo()` function. The arguments are similar to the
`arc_geo()` function, but now we specify the input data columns with the `x` and
`y` arguments. The dataset used here is from the geocoder query above. The
single line address is returned in a column named by the `address`.

```{r}
reverse <- arc_reverse_geo(
  x = lat_longs$longitude,
  y = lat_longs$latitude,
  address = "address_found"
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(reverse)
```

It is possible also to search for specific locations within or near a reference
are or location using [category
filtering](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-category-filtering.htm).
See more information in the documentation of the data base `arc_categories`.

In the following example we would look for POIs related with food (i.e.
Restaurants, Coffee Shops, Bakeries) near the Eiffel Tower in France.

```{r eiffel, fig.cap="Example: Food places near the Eiffel Tower"}
library(ggplot2) # For plotting

# Step 1: Locate Eiffel Tower, using multifield query

eiffel_tower <- arc_geo_multi(
  address = "Tour Eiffel",
  city = "Paris",
  countrycode = "FR",
  langcode = "FR",
  custom_query = list(outFields = "LongLabel")
)

# Display results
eiffel_tower %>%
  select(lon, lat, LongLabel)


# Use lon,lat to boots the search and using category = Food
food_eiffel <- arc_geo_categories("Food",
  x = eiffel_tower$lon,
  y = eiffel_tower$lat,
  limit = 50, full_results = TRUE
)

# Plot by Food Type
ggplot(eiffel_tower, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(shape = 17, color = "red", size = 4) +
  geom_point(data = food_eiffel, aes(x, y, color = Type)) +
  labs(
    title = "Food near the Eiffel Tower",
    subtitle = "Using arcgecoder",
    color = "Type of place",
    x = "",
    y = "",
    caption = "Data from ArcGIS REST API services"
  )
```

### **arcgeocoder** and **r-spatial**

It is straightforward to convert the results of **arcgeocoder** to an **sf**
object (geospatial format):

```{r eiffel_sf, fig.cap="Example: Food places near the Eiffel Tower using the sf package."}
library(sf)

food_eiffel_sf <- st_as_sf(food_eiffel,
  coords = c("lon", "lat"),
  # The CRS of the resulting coords is here
  crs = eiffel_tower$wkid
)

food_eiffel_sf

ggplot(food_eiffel_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = Type)) +
  coord_sf(crs = 3035)
```

See additional articles showing how **arcgeocoder** can be use in combination
with **leaflet** to create [dynamic
maps](https://dieghernan.github.io/arcgeocoder/articles/ex_leaflet.html) and
with **sf** and **terra** to create [static
maps](https://dieghernan.github.io/arcgeocoder/articles/ex_static.html).
