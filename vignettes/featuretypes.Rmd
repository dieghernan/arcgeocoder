## Reverse geocode details

The purpose of reverse geocoding is to answer the question: What's near this
location? To answer this question, the `reverseGeocode` operation provided by
the **ArcGIS REST API** returns the most relevant feature near an input location
based on a prioritized hierarchy of feature types.

The hierarchy is summarized in the table below, ordered by descending priority.
Unless otherwise noted, each feature type is only returned when the distance
between the input location and the feature is within the tolerance specified in
the *Search Tolerance* column.

| Feature type                                                 | Search tolerance | Comments                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `StreetInt`                                                  | 10 meters        | Intersections are only returned when `featuretypes = "StreetInt"` is included in the request.                                                             |
| `StreetAddress` (near), `DistanceMarker`, or `StreetName`    | 3 meters         | Candidates of type `StreetName` are only returned if `featureTypes = "streetName"` is included in the request.                                            |
| `POI` centroid                                               | 25 meters        | A business or landmark that can be represented by a point.                                                                                                |
| `Subaddress`                                                 | 10 meters        | `Subaddress` candidates, which can be features such as apartments or floors in a building, maybe not being returned under certain conditions.             |

| `StreetAddress` (distant), `DistanceMarker`, or `StreetName` | 100 meters       | Candidates of type `StreetName` are only returned if `featuretypes = "StreetName"` is included in the request.                                            |

| `Postal` or `Locality` area                                  | within boundary  | If the input location intersects multiple boundaries, the feature with the smallest area is returned.                                                     |

: **Table 1**: Adapted from ArcGIS REST API `reverseGeocode`

In **arcgeocoder**, this hierarchy is implemented in `arc_reverse_geo()`,
specifically through the `featuretypes` parameter. The default value
(`featuretypes = NULL`) does not include the parameter in the API call. In this
case, the hierarchy presented in the previous table would apply.

It is possible to narrow down the output of the query to a specific feature type
or a list of feature types.The possible values supported for this parameter are:

-   `"StreetInt"`
-   `"DistanceMarker"`
-   `"StreetAddress"`
-   `"StreetName"`
-   `"POI"`
-   `"Subaddress"`
-   `"PointAddress"`
-   `"Postal"`
-   `"Locality"`

As mentioned, is to possible to include several feature types. If more than one
value is specified for the parameter, the values must be separated by a comma,
with no spaces after the comma.

### single `featuretypes` value


```r
arc_reverse_geo(..., featuretypes = "PointAddress")
```

### multiple `featuretypes` value


```r
arc_reverse_geo(..., featuretypes = "PointAddress,StreetAddress")
```

## Examples

In the following examples, we would provide different examples for better
understanding.


```r
library(arcgeocoder)
```

### Example 1: Match to `POI` centroid returned

In this example, we do not provide any value to the `featuretypes` parameter.
This input location is within the search tolerance of both `POI` and
`PointAddress` features, but a match to the `POI` centroid is returned because
it has a higher priority (see [**Table 1**](#table1)). Note that the output
field `Addr_type` indicates the type of feature.


```r
example_x <- -117.205525
example_y <- 34.038232

api_poi <- arc_reverse_geo(
  x = example_x, y = example_y,
  langcode = "EN", full_results = TRUE, verbose = TRUE
)

knitr::kable(api_poi[, c("x", "y", "address", "lon", "lat", "Addr_type")])
```



|         x|        y|address                                                            |       lon|      lat|Addr_type |
|---------:|--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------|---------:|--------:|:---------|
| -117.2055| 34.03823|InlandPsych, 255 Terracina Blvd, Ste 204, Redlands, CA, 92373, USA | -117.2055| 34.03823|POI       |



### Example 2: Match to `StreetAddress` match returned

We specify here the type of feature we want to get using
`featuretypes = "StreetAddress"`.


```r
api_address <- arc_reverse_geo(
  x = example_x, y = example_y,
  featuretypes = "StreetAddress",
  langcode = "EN", full_results = TRUE, verbose = TRUE
)

knitr::kable(api_address[, c("x", "y", "address", "lon", "lat", "Addr_type")])
```



|         x|        y|address                                          |       lon|      lat|Addr_type     |
|---------:|--------:|:------------------------------------------------|---------:|--------:|:-------------|
| -117.2055| 34.03823|251-255 Terracina Blvd, Redlands, CA, 92373, USA | -117.2057| 34.03799|StreetAddress |



### Example 3: `Locality` match returned


```r
api_local <- arc_reverse_geo(
  x = example_x, y = example_y,
  featuretypes = "Locality",
  langcode = "EN", full_results = TRUE, verbose = TRUE
)

knitr::kable(api_local[, c("x", "y", "address", "lon", "lat", "Addr_type")])
```



|         x|        y|address                           |       lon|      lat|Addr_type |
|---------:|--------:|:---------------------------------|---------:|--------:|:---------|
| -117.2055| 34.03823|South Redlands, Redlands, CA, USA | -117.2055| 34.03823|Locality  |



### Example 4: multiple values

When multiple values are included in the API call, the hierarchy explained in
[**Table 1**](#table1) would still be applied on the requested `featuretypes`.


```r
api_multiple <- arc_reverse_geo(
  x = example_x, y = example_y,
  featuretypes = "Locality,StreetInt,StreetAddress",
  langcode = "EN", full_results = TRUE, verbose = TRUE
)

knitr::kable(api_multiple[, c("x", "y", "address", "lon", "lat", "Addr_type")])
```



|         x|        y|address                                          |       lon|      lat|Addr_type     |
|---------:|--------:|:------------------------------------------------|---------:|--------:|:-------------|
| -117.2055| 34.03823|251-255 Terracina Blvd, Redlands, CA, 92373, USA | -117.2057| 34.03799|StreetAddress |



### Example 5: No results for specific `featuretypes`

In the following example we present a case where only certain `featuretypes` are
near the requested location. In this case, when reverse geocoding the North Pole
the API would return a `Locality` but no `StreetAddress` is found.

When it is not possible to return results, `arc_reverse_geo()` returns an empty
**tibble**.


```r
# North Pole

npole <- arc_reverse_geo(x = 0, y = 90, langcode = "EN", full_results = TRUE)

knitr::kable(npole[, c("x", "y", "address", "Addr_type")])
```



|  x|  y|address    |Addr_type |
|--:|--:|:----------|:---------|
|  0| 90|North Pole |Locality  |



```r

# But no StreetAddress
npole2 <- arc_reverse_geo(
  x = 0, y = 90, langcode = "EN", full_results = TRUE,
  featuretypes = "StreetAddress"
)

knitr::kable(npole2)
```



|  x|  y|address |
|--:|--:|:-------|
|  0| 90|NA      |



## Conclusion

The API would return different results for the same `x,y` values depending on
the value of `featuretypes`. By using `featuretypes = NULL` the feature type
returned would depend on the hierarchy explained in [**Table 1**](#table1).

Depending on the location, the `featuretype` filter may not return results,
hence for general purposes using `featuretypes = NULL` is safer.
